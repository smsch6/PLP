# Introduction to R

## History
1. Robert Gentleman, and Ross Ihaka
2. R was created by statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of New Zealand, Auckland. It was developed to address the lack of accessibility to statistical software, specifically the language of S, which was developed in Bell Laboratories as statistical analysis software but became monetized and restricted. R is open-source and free to usem unlike its predecessor S. 
3. R is used primarily for statistical analysis and machine learning for data analysis. It is widely used in the fields of Data Science, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and general data analysis.
4. R has excellent documentation on [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/). Most information about the language, its syntax, and installation can be found here.
