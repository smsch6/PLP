# Introduction to R

## History
1. Robert Gentleman, and Ross Ihaka
2. R was created by statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of New Zealand, Auckland. It was developed to address the lack of accessibility to statistical software, specifically the language of S, which was developed in Bell Laboratories as statistical analysis software but became monetized and restricted.
3. R is used primarily for statistical analysis and machine learning for data analysis. It is widely used in the fields of Data Science, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and general data analysis.
