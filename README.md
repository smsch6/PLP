# Introduction to R

## History
1. The name of this language is R.
2. R was created by statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of New Zealand, Auckland. It was developed to address the lack of accessibility to statistical software, specifically the language of S, which was developed in Bell Laboratories as statistical analysis software but became monetized and restricted. R is open-source and free to use unlike its predecessor S. 
3. R is used primarily for statistical analysis and machine learning for data analysis. It is widely used in the fields of Data Science, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and general data analysis.
4. R has excellent documentation on [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/). Most information about the language, its syntax, and installation can be found here.

## Getting Started
A simple and effective method of coding in R is through RStudio. RStudio allows users to write in R in a graphical interface, where everything necessary to code in R can be viewed in one window. Both R and RStudio must be installed, and R must be installed first.

### Installing R
1. Open [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) in an internet window.
2. Under "Download" below the R logo, click on "CRAN". You'll have to choose a CRAN mirror, one of many servers that store identical and recent versions of R.
3. Choose any CRAN mirror located in the US, ideally one geographically close to your location. (Statlib from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA works well for those located in the Northeastern US.)
4. After selecting a CRAN mirror, follow the Operating-System appropriate link under "Download and Install R".
